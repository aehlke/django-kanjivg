This is a support lib for Manabi. There's some reusable code somewhere in here, but it would need to be decoupled some more from Manabi first.

It's separated into its own lib because it contains a bunch of huge SVG files for kanji (thanks, Kimtaro) that I don't want bundled in with the Manabi repo.
